# Lost n Boxed

**Lost n Boxed** is a memory-based game built in Scratch where players race against the clock to identify a missing collectible figure. The game challenges focus, memory, and quick reactions, making it both fun and engaging for players of all ages.

I designed and developed the entire project from scratch during a two-week summer session. This included the game concept, character and background design, gameplay programming, and interactive elements. Building a cohesive identity for the game and seeing it come to life taught me a lot about time management, creativity, and technical problem-solving. It also inspired me to continue exploring concept-driven, interactive projects.
